# Analog-to-Digital Converter with PWM Integration (MAX10 ADC + Qsys)

This project integrates the MAX10 Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) IP block with a previously designed PWM system using Qsys and Quartus Prime 16.1. It demonstrates system-level design techniques on the Terasic DE10-Lite FPGA architecture using HDL modules, Qsys IP integration, Avalon bus protocols, and mixed-language components (VHDL + Verilog).

>  *This project was compiled, placed, and routed successfully using Quartus Prime, but not deployed on physical hardware due to lack of DE10-Lite board access. Design behavior was verified through synthesis reports, RTL Viewer, and Qsys configuration.*

## 📌 Overview

- Utilizes the **MAX10 ADC IP** to digitize analog signals.
- Integrates **PWM**, **debounce switches**, and **PLL**-generated clocks.
- Built using **Qsys Platform Designer**:
  - Modular ADC core with channel sequencer
  - ALTPLL for 10 MHz ADC clock generation
  - JTAG to Avalon Master Bridge for live debugging
  - Avalon-MM Pipeline Bridge for interconnect
