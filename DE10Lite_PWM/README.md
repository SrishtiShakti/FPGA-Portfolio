# 💡 DE10-Lite PWM – Pulse Width Modulation Hardware Design

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a pulse width modulation (PWM) LED controller on the DE10-Lite board using a combination of Verilog HDL, schematic design, and Altera IP cores (ALTPLL). The PWM system allows fine-grained intensity control of LEDs through switch-controlled duty cycles. The design features a fully integrated fabric setup, including a PLL for frequency synthesis and a debouncer for stable user input handling.

✅ Built using Verilog + Schematic (`.bdf`)  
✅ Simulated using ModelSim-Altera  
✅ Synthesized and implemented with Quartus Prime 16.1  
✅ Target Device: MAX10 FPGA (10M50DAF484C6GES)

| LEDR[0]          | Output   | 1 bit        | PWM-controlled LED output                             |
| duty_cycle[2:0]  | Internal | 3 bits       | Output of debouncers, fed to `pwm_gen`                |
| pwm_clk, dc_clk  | Internal | 1 bit each   | 25 MHz and 30 KHz clocks generated by ALTPLL          |

## 🧪 Simulation Strategy

- Created schematic symbol files for `pwm_gen.v` and `debouncer.v` using Quartus.
- Converted the top-level schematic (`pwm_led_top.bdf`) to Verilog (`pwm_led_top.v`) for simulation.
- Launched ModelSim-Altera from Quartus.
- Set `MAX10_CLK1_50` clock period to 20ns (50 MHz).
- Set `duty_cycle_clk` to 3000ns (30 KHz).
- Forced switch values and ran time-domain simulation (up to 100 µs).
- Verified correct PWM waveform output with respect to `SW[2:0]` values.

## 📊 Testbench Results (ModelSim Manual Forcing)

| SW (Duty Cycle) | Expected PWM Output | Observed Behavior                             |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `000`           | ~0%                 | LED off (low pulse width)                     |
| `111`           | ~100%               | LED almost always on                          |
| `010`           | ~25%                | PWM shows short high pulses                   |
| `101`           | ~75%                | PWM shows long high pulses                    |

> ✔ Debouncer introduces delay before stable duty cycle input propagates  
> ✔ PWM output modulates correctly with varying `SW` inputs
