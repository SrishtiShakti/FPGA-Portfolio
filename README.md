# FPGA Portfolio

This repository showcases a curated collection of FPGA design modules implemented in both **Verilog** and **VHDL**. Each module illustrates fundamental digital design concepts such as memory structures (RAM, FIFO), finite state machines (FSMs), arithmetic logic units (ALUs),PPWM with PLL aand debouncer, and 7-segment display control.

Projects are developed as part of the *FPGA Design for Embedded Systems* specialization and are intended for both learning and demonstration. Each design includes:

- Synthesizable HDL code
- Self-written or course-provided testbenches
- Simulation results using **ModelSim**
- Optional Quartus projects for synthesis and board-level deployment

Where possible, equivalent VHDL and Verilog versions are included for direct comparison.
