# FPGA Portfolio

This repository showcases a curated collection of FPGA design modules implemented in both **Verilog** and **VHDL**. Each module illustrates fundamental digital design concepts such as memory structures (RAM, FIFO), finite state machines (FSMs), arithmetic logic units (ALUs),PPWM with PLL aand debouncer, and 7-segment display control.

Projects are developed as part of the *FPGA Design for Embedded Systems* specialization and are intended for both learning and demonstration. Each design includes:

- Synthesizable HDL code
- Self-written or course-provided testbenches
- Simulation results using **ModelSim**
- Optional Quartus projects for synthesis and board-level deployment

Where possible, equivalent VHDL and Verilog versions are included for direct comparison.

## ðŸ§© Modules Overview

### â–¸ [Problem PWM_With_PLL: PWM Generator with PLL and Debouncer](https://github.com/SrishtiShakti/FPGA-Portfolio/tree/main/PWM_With_PLL)

* **Verilog**: `PWM_With_PLL/pwm_gen.v`, `PWM_With_PLL/debouncer.v`, `PWM_With_PLL/pwm_led_top.v`, `PWM_With_PLL/pwm_pll.v`  
* **Schematic**: `PWM_With_PLL/pwm_led_top.bdf`  
* ðŸ’¡ Implements a PWM signal generator with duty cycle control using switches, a debouncer for input stability, and a PLL-generated clock for precise timing. Uses a schematic-based top-level design connected to Verilog modules and IP blocks.  
* âœ… Simulated in ModelSim (via schematic-generated Verilog HDL). Built in Quartus Prime using a combination of Verilog source files, PLL IP core, and a schematic (.bdf) as top-level design. Duty cycle control verified via waveform outputs. Project tested without needing a DE10-Lite board.

### â–¸ [Problem C4M1P5: BCD Adder (Algorithmic Version with IF-ELSE)](https://github.com/SrishtiShakti/FPGA-Portfolio/tree/main/C4M1P5_BCD_Adder2)

* ðŸ’¡ Implements a BCD adder using an algorithmic VHDL approach with `if-else` and comparison operators. Computes the sum `A + B + cin`, performs correction if the raw sum exceeds 9, and outputs a valid two-digit BCD sum.
* âœ… Simulated in ModelSim with self-written testbench; displays A and B on HEX4/HEX3 and the final sum on HEX1/HEX0. Debugging via LEDR. Quartus RTL viewer confirms synthesized logic using comparators, adders, and conditional structures.
