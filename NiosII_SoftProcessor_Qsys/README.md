# üöÄ Nios II Soft Processor System on DE10-Lite (Quartus 16.1)

This project is a complete embedded system design using the **Intel (Altera) Quartus Prime 16.1** tools targeting the **Terasic DE10-Lite FPGA board**. It implements a custom processor system using the **NIOS II softcore CPU**, peripherals, and Qsys system integration flow.

> ‚úÖ Note: I do not have access to the DE10-Lite hardware board. This project has been implemented, compiled, and simulated as far as possible in **Quartus Prime** and **Qsys**, without physical deployment or testing on actual hardware.
